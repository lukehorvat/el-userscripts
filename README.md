# el-maps-extractor

Extracts size info from map files. Also generates image thumbnails of maps.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Note to self

The files in the `maps` directory were copied directly from the EL client's `data/maps` directory. The images were also manually converted from `.dds` to `.png` using Mac Preview.
