# el-item-image-extractor

Converts item texture files to individual item images. Also generates a JSON file mapping item names to image IDs.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Note to self

The textures in this repo were copied from the EL client's `data` directory (`/Applications/Eternal Lands.app/Contents/Resources/data/textures`) and then converted from `.dds` to `.png` using Mac Preview. So if new items are added in a future client update, just repeat that same process.
