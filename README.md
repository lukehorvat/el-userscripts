# el-item-image-extractor

Node.js script that converts item texture files to individual item images. Also generates a JS file mapping item names to image IDs.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Note to self

The `textures` directory in `src/data` was directly copied from the EL client's `data` directory. Non-item texture files were removed.
