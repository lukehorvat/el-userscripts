# el-item-image-extractor

Converts item texture files to individual item images. Also generates a JS file mapping item names to image IDs.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Note to self

The images in the `textures` directory were copied directly from the EL client's `data/textures` directory, and were also manually converted from `.dds` to `.png` using Mac Preview.
